<h1>Haya wacha tuendelee,</h1>
<p>Then she met someone different. A young boy named Tito. Like every other girl Phe played hard to get but this boy played his cards right. Days passed and Phe could not go 
  a day without thinking about Tito. At first Phe was scared and feared abandonment but she told herself that she is going to put herself out there and try new things. Na 
  hivyo ndio akaamua kuingia box. Everything was new to her, she didn't know what was right or wrong, what to do and what not to do, in short she did not trust herself 
  and just went with his flow. And for the first time she question what love really is and whether she even believed in it. This is how she decided to define love;
  There is no single explanation to what love is ju hadi the bible does not describe it in one sentence. One thing I know is that we choose to love those we love
  even with there imperfections. It's choosing the same things or person even when it seems impossible to continue down the same road. It's choosing to grow with
  the same person through all the storms.It may not feel like butterflies everydday but it is there. And so I choose to love him. I choose to grow with him. I may feel 
  confused at times because I am doing this for the first time but I am ready to learn, fix, laugh and keep choosing you. I may not be perfect but I am learning to love
  more and more everyday.</p>
  <p>And for the first time in a really long time Phe was HAPPY, contented with herself and not afraid of making mistakes anymore.</p>
  <p>THE END!!❤️</p>
