<h1>Dear Tito,</h1>
<p>You are the best gift life ever sent my way. From our first chat to this moment, every second with you is precious. I cherish the way you care, your kind heart, and the endless laughter you bring to my days. Here’s to us, and the beautiful future I know we'll build together. I love you deeply and forever. ❤️</p>
